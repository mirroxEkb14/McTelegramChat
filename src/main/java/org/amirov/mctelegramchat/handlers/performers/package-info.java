/**
 * This {@code performers} package inside the {@code handlers} holds classes that are meant to do certain logic
 * depending on what a player chose inside the main menu gui. It is needed to put the logic of these events in these
 * separate classes, because their performance requires more than one method and additional constants to it, so the main
 * {@link org.amirov.mctelegramchat.handlers.MainMenuHandler} class would be too overloaded.
